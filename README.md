# Xamarin Studio add-in for MvvmCross solutions

This installs project templates for creating MvvmCross solutions.

Currently this only supports a new MvvmCross solution targetting iOS and Android.  
This creates a solution with 3 projects:

* A Core PCL containing a view model
* An iOS project
* An Android project
