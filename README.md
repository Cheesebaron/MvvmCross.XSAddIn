# Xamarin Studio add-in for MVVMCross solutions

This installs templates for creating MVVMCross solutions.

Currently this only supports a new MVVMCross solution targetting iOS and Android.  
This creates a solution with 3 projects:

* A Core PCL containing a view model
* An iOS project
* An Android project
